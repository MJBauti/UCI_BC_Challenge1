## Module 1 Homework

This is the Repository for Michael Bautista's Challenge 1 Assignment 

I have updated the code by: 
* Consolidating repeat code into smaller groups
* Adding comments
* Restructuring CSS to more similarly match HTML flow
* Ensuring all Links work properly
* Renaming Div tabs to appropriate HTML semantics
* Making the intitial image an image in HTML to add alt property and title
* Including alt properties on all imagery
* Including titles on photo images
* Changing the Website Title to Horiseon

When viewed the website will still look like the original:
